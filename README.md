Regarding Ted Cruz.

I'm wondering when he feels at peace. He spends his entire day grifting and gathering money from people dumb enough to believe his populist schtick. He spends every waking hour deceiving people for money and power. But does he have any moments to recollect in tranquility the things he's done to, ostensibly, generate wealth for himself and his family? Does he feel that he's created anything of value for himself or his constituents for whom he wields his power as a senator and on behalf of whom he deceives and grifts, from them, money to maintain his status as a senator via reelection? Is there any time he is able to feel the joy of his labor? And if he is unable to enjoy the benefits of said labor, without that peace that usually comes with creation or production of an artifact, tangible or intangible, does he become anxious and feel as though he needs to be more of a grifter and more deceptive? It is even worse to imagine that he is unconditionally loved by the people who he desires love from. And if he is loved, does that love enable him to greater depravity? Or knowing that he will never be loved, do limits to his depravity even exist?
